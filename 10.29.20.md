## Temporary Wiring Diagram

In order to make sure the robot functions properly, we have to know which ports each of the motors, sensors, and other electronics will go in. For that we put together a wiring diagram.

| Port | Device                  |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| 5    | Vision Sensor           |
| 11   | Left Intake Motor       |
| 14   | Left-Back Drive Motor   |
| 15   | Left-Front Drive Motor  |
| 16   | Right-Front Drive Motor |
| 17   | Right-Back Drive Motor  |
| 20   | Right Intake Motor      |
| 21   | Radio                   |

Each of the ports was chosen strategically. Since the Brain will be mounted horizontally on the back of the robot, the drivebase motor ports are all on the bottom center of the brain. The intake motor ports are on the bottom edges so that the wires can extend down the sides of the robot and reach the intake motors at the front corners of the robot. The vision sensor port is at the top of the Brain since the Vision Sensor will likely be at the top of the robot looking down at anything in front of the robot. The radio is in port 21 off to the right side of the brain so it can reach the radio mounted vertically on the right side of the C-Channel.

## Vertical Supports

Alexander finished screwing on the vertical bars to support the robot's elevator, then he bent a long flat 30 by 5 piece of metal to make a J shaped curve for the ball to follow from the intake up the elevator.
