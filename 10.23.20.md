The whole club had a meeting after school to discuss how our robotics club will work this year. This was the first meeting to welcome all of our Clear Connections students who attend school virtually this semester. One of our sponsors, Ms. Gilbert, judged notebooks for VEX in the past, and helped get us started with our Engineering Notebook.
