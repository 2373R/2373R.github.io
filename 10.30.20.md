## Assembling the Elevator Backing

## Wiring the Robot

With the elevator guide in place, the Brain could be screwed on. So I attached the brain and wired the robot according to the diagram in yesterday's entry. However, the diagram needed a few changes now that the brain is actually on the robot.

| Port | Device                  |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| 11   | Left Intake Motor       |
| 14   | Left-Back Drive Motor   |
| 15   | Left-Front Drive Motor  |
| 16   | Right-Front Drive Motor |
| 17   | Right-Back Drive Motor  |
| 20   | Right Intake Motor      |
| 21   | Radio                   |

For the time being, we decided against a vision sensor, not because it is too complicated, but because it isn't necessary for autonomous.
